/* 
*CMPS 12A HW 5*

Code generator game program!

The computer generates a random code, and prompts the user for a code guess input. 
The computer then compares that guess to the randomly generated code, and prints out the number of exact matches and close matches.
Exact matches are characterized by the same number and location, close matches are the same number but in different locations.
