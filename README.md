# SecretCodeGame
# This game randomly generates a secret 4-digit code, which the user may attempt to guess! Close numbers signify numbers that appear in the code, but are not in the same position in the input as they appear in the secret code. Exact numbers are numbers which are both the correct digit, and in the correct position as in the secret code.
#If you are stumped, a cheat function can be used by inputting only a *!
